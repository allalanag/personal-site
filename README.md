# Personal Website
This is the repo for my personal website that serves as my consolidated portfolio.

I've also served the following on my website:

## Wallet
##### [*/wallet/wallet-app](https://maanavgarg.com/wallet/wallet-app.html)

Wallet is a personal financial management application that provides the user with an aggregated dashboard with their connected accounts, which allows them to monitor and budget their personal finances.

This is served as an extension to my website and uses Plaid API to handle the connections between Wallet and the respective financial institutions.

## Resume - Online Version 
##### [*/resume](https://maanavgarg.com/resume.html)

This is the **online** version of my resume, that outlines **all** of my experience thus far and is served as an extension of my website. This will always be the most updated version of my resume!

Where all the styling and functionality were developed from scratch.
